				<div class="head sub1">Chicken</div>
				<p>A classic chicken starter recipe! This grilled chicken is a popular Punjabi snack that can be served with onion rings and a green chutney. The juicy and full of spice chicken pieces just fill you up with its delectable taste and makes this dish of Tandoori Chicken a must have snack at a dinner party with family or friends</p>

				<div class="head sub2">Beef</div>
				<p>Mongolian Beef is a recipe that I’ve been cooking for clients for many years for a number of reasons. One, people love anything that tastes like Chinese takeout. Two, the sweet flavor of the dark brown sugar mixed with the salty soy sauce and the strong ginger and garlic is incredibly addicting and three you get to enjoy it over a mountain of steamed rice, which if you are anything like me is your happy place.</p>

				<div class="head sub3">Mutton</div>
				<p>Sizzling lamb chops in a skillet creates a beautiful crust that’s loaded with flavor! Marinating in garlic, rosemary, thyme, and olive oil infuses herbaceous notes and tenderizes the meat for a fast and stunning meal.</p>
